Lista:

* Write the Readme for your project before you write the actual code.

* As a byproduct of writing a Readme in order to know what you need to implement, you'll have a very nice piece

* If you're working with a team of developers you get even more mileage out of your Readme.

* It's a lot simpler to have a discussion based on something written down.

Consider the process of writing the Readme for your project as the true act of creation. This is where all your brilliant ideas should be expressed. This document should stand on its own as a testament to your creativity and expressiveness. The Readme should be the single most important document in your codebase; writing it first is the proper thing to do.
